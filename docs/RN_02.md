# [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)

```bash
yarn add @react-navigation/native
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens @react-native-community/masked-view react-native-safe-area-context

# depends on whatever you need
yarn add @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
```

```bash
# iOS 操作
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

# To finalize installation of react-native-screens for Android, add the following two lines to dependencies section in android/app/build.gradle:
implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.1.0-rc01'
implementation 'androidx.swiperefreshlayout:swiperefreshlayout:1.1.0-alpha02'
```

To finalize installation of react-native-gesture-handler, add the following at the top (make sure it's at the top and there's nothing else before it) of your entry file, such as index.js or App.js:

```js
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

> Note: If you skip this step, your app may crash in production even if it works fine in development.
